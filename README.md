# TkTimer
 Offline rubix cube timer using only python built-ins

## Features
- timer (that only works if you have autorepeat in your keyboard like in X window manager)
- scramble generation (almost random move scrambles)
- draw scramble (actually good feature)
- database using sqlite (totally very effecient code using it) (with one click copy times)
- summary list/average calculation
- load from cstimer export to file (but not export cuz u wont need it)

## Use it
1. Install python 3, using your package manager or at python.org
2. Download the 2 files in the repo using `git` or the "Download Zip" button and unzip it
3. No need to pip install anything, you may have to install `python3-tkinter` on certain linux distros though
4. Make sure the files are at the same directory, `cd` your way there or use your file manager and...
5. `python main.py`, have fun
